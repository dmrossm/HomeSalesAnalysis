# Seattle Affordable Housing Initiative

## Business Problem

  The Low Income Housing Institute (LIHI) has received a $60 million grant from Amazon to purchase and lease affordable homes to working class families.
Our goal was to find an efficient model that can help choose which homes to buy, to maximize the number of homes LIHI can purchase.

## Dataset Characteristics

  The dataset describes around 22,000 homes sold in between 2014-2015, with over 20 different characteristics listed: price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square feet of living space, and more.

## Key Takaways
These features were used to develop the most effective model: 
1) Living space square footage (LSSF): Square footage of living space in the home
2) Closest 15 neighbors living space square footage: The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
3) Latitude: Latitude coordinate
4) Grade: Overall grade of the house. Related to the construction and design of the house

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data Cleaning Process
1) Narrowed data to single family homes (2-5 bedrooms).
2) Removed extraneous variables (view, year renovated, etc.)
3) Eliminated other outliers (excessive basement space, bathrooms, floors, etc.)
4) Matched locational data to city names.
